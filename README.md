# portfolioTest

 - The Portfolio class has a HashMap that contains a String as a key (Used to easily find a stock on a portfolio by name) and a Stock as a value. As this is a Key value variable we ensure there are no repeated stocks.
 - The Stock class has a String name and a HashMap that contains a Date as key (Used to find stock prices for a given date) and a price as a value.
 - In order to return both proffit and annualized return from the "Profit" method a Proift class was created containing both.
 - The Portfolio and the Stock classes were developed using TDD.
